# project comments:

format: This script is a generic pretty-printer for JSON, XML, and YAML files. It reads content from standard input and attempts to parse and pretty-print it. If it can't parse the content, it outputs a failure message. Alternatives for this could include standalone formatting tools for each type, such as jq for JSON, xmllint for XML, and yq for YAML.

vagrant.sh: This script is used to extract port information from the output of vagrant status release and write it to a .env file. The ports for HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH are extracted using grep and cut. An alternative to this script could be to use a more specific parsing tool like awk or perl to extract the port information.

ide: This script is a tmux session setup script. It creates new tmux windows with specific names and commands executed in each window. The commands include opening readme and cheatsheet files in vim, viewing various .txt files, and opening a shell. An alternative to this script would be to use a different terminal multiplexer like screen or a GUI-based terminal emulator that supports splitting windows.

Remember that these alternatives might require adjustments based on your specific needs and environment.
