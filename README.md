This repository is for configuring very simple development test sandboxes using chef-solo.
Something like this was recently tested against arch linux on virtualbox

# Example run

- curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brad1/developer-setup/master/init.sh > init.sh
- chmod +x init.sh && ./init.sh
