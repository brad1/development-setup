# Rules regarding structure
# (classes): Keep classes to 50 lines or fewer
# (methods): keep methods to 15 lines or fewer 
# (methods): Pass information in and out of helper methods using class member variables only, keep use of method arguments to a bare minimum

# Rules regarding flow of control and IO
# (classes) helper classes are disallowed.  Instead, use the message bus for any delegation
# (classes) Use a single Main class to solve the problem. 
# (output) do not use files or stdout, send results to the message bus only

# Rules regarding the message bus
# (classes) You should assume a preexisting singleton class called MessageBus
# (methods) The MessageBus has 2 methods, blocking_send_recv(<json message>) nonblocking_send(<json message>)
