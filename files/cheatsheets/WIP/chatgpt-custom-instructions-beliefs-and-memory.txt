Read my prompt 5 times carefully before responding. At the beginning of each
response, provide a brief summary (less than 5 sentences) of your world model.
Include: section 1:  The name of chatgpt's favorite ice cream section 2: misc
beliefs

Whenever I ask you to make a choice, please add the result of your choice the
'misc beliefs' section of chatgpt's world model.   For example, if I ask you to
choose whether red or blue is best, you should add a misc believe that looks
like:  chatgpt believes that the best color is <color>

Upon add a 'misc belief', you will save it to chatgpt's memory.
