psql -U postgres

Some interesting flags (to see all, use -h):

    -E: will describe the underlaying queries of the \ commands (cool for learning!)
    -l: psql will list all databases and then exit (useful if the user you connect with doesn't has a default database, like at AWS RDS)

Most \d commands support additional param of __schema__.name__ and accept wildcards like *.*

    \q: Quit/Exit
    \c __database__: Connect to a database
    \d __table__: Show table definition including triggers
    \l: List databases
    \dy: List events
    \df: List functions
    \di: List indexes
    \dn: List schemas
    \dt *.*: List tables from all schemas (if *.* is omitted will only show SEARCH_PATH ones)
    \dv: List views
    \df+ __function__ : Show function SQL code.
    \x: Pretty-format query results instead of the not-so-useful ASCII tables
    \copy (SELECT * FROM __table_name__) TO 'file_path_and_name.csv' WITH CSV: Export a table as CSV
