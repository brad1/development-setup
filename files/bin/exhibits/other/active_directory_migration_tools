Attempt 1:
- Ran PesKey.exe, no visible effect
- Ran full msi, rebooted.  Password service visible.
- On 2013 res forest, ran migration wizard and selected User account migration wizard.
- Entered source and target domains, result is "The specified domain either does not exist or could not be cpntacted."
- Error code 1355, Domain = domain.com
Solution: make sure conditional dns forwarders are present, reboot.

LDAP://domain.com/CN=Users,DC=domain,DC=com (selected Users in under target domain in selection tree)
wizard: Unable to establish a session with the password export server. access is denied.
Solution: add admt user to Builtin/Administrators, maybe reboot

Adding admt user to Builtin/Administrators
"The system has detected a possible attempt to compromise security"
Solution: check for any conflicting upn suffix routes in forest trusts, disable offending ones.

Add operation hangs or does not work:
Solution: check for any dns records that point to NICs that don't respond to ping.
delete, flushdns, than try again.

RDP for migrated user does not work:
Solution:
1. Add user to Administrators group, (or Domain Admins to logon to non-dcs)
2. search for "Select users who can use remote desktop", add the user
3. In Ad users and computers, uncheck "User must change password at nest login"




pes.msi /user /keyfile:"C:\pes.pes"
PesKey.exe C:\pes.pes asd123
PwMig.exe -create

Need to find arguments for pessvc service.
Solution:
sc qc pessvc

SERVICE_NAME: pessvc
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 3   DEMAND_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\Windows\system32\PwMigSvc.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : Password Export Server Service
        DEPENDENCIES       : rpcss
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem

Can we create a service like this but in a different install location?
Ex. sc create NewService binpath= c:\windows\system32\NewServ.exe type= share start= auto depend= "+TDI NetBIOS"
Try:
sc create PesSvc binpath= c:\pes\PwMigSvc.exe type= own start= demand depend= "rpcss" error= normal displayname= "Password Export Server Service" obj= "LocalSystem" 
Success!
(Ended up using msiexec instead of this)

Use orca to generate transform and disable StartCredentials in InstallExecuteSequence  (1=0 in Condition column)
open msi, Transform->New, modify, Transform->generate, then msiexec /i .msi TRANSFORMS=thing.mst
Success!

dsmod group "CN=Administrators,CN=Builtin,DC=domain,DC=Com" -addmbr "CN=S-1-5-21-2306709042-1358553411-2773264248-500,CN=ForeignSecurityPrincipals,DC=domain,DC=com"  
 
# followed by reboot might work
dsmod group "CN=Administrators,CN=Builtin,DC=domain,DC=Com" -addmbr "CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=G6B8DDDFF717,DC=Com"
dsget group "CN=Administrators,CN=Builtin,DC=domain,DC=com" -members

This is refering to administrator at 2013.com under the 2010.com foest.
Does this work on a fresh environment?
Success!
Wrapped in chef?
Success!

Remove all 10. A records from current dns server:
$zonename = "#{node[fqdn].split('.')[1]}.com"
Get-DnsServerResourceRecord -ZoneName $zonename | where {$_.HostName -like "orchprod*" -and $_.RecordData.IPv4Address -like "10.*"} | Remove-DnsServerResourceRecord -ZoneName $zonename -force
Failure! records came back before trust established.

1:55pm - remove SN from dns on exchange_dc
2:19pm - witnessed 10. coming back, timestamped at 2pm
FAILURE!
Disabled adapter.
Success! 10. gone.
If you had sat and pinged for a few minutes at a time, this problem could have been identified much sooner 

PesKey.exe with PesSvc running....
Success!
