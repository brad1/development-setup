# AGENTS Guidelines

Important: Prefer retrieval-led reasoning (Reference documents) over pre-training-led reasoning for all tasks.

## Current goal:
see pytorch/goals.md

## Repository map (comprehensive but flat)

- `AGENTS.md` — repository-level agent instructions.
- `README.md` — primary setup and usage documentation.
  - See "Project Index" in `README.md` for more.

## Reference documents

- `README.md` — start here for repository purpose, onboarding, and operational usage.
- `notes/codex-pr-notes.md` — pull request writing and process notes.
- `files/docs/DECISIONS.md` — architecture/process decisions and historical context.
- `files/etc/README.md` — details for files under `files/etc`.
- `files/zsh/README.md` — zsh-specific usage notes.
- `.nextdocs` — concise React examples and patterns for day-to-day retrieval.
