# AGENTS Guidelines

This repository is a collection of scripts, notes, and configuration. While some of the files relate to Chef, the user no longer works on a team that uses Chef. You do not need to maintain Chef workflows, but please do not break existing Chef compatibility on purpose.

## Contribution Tips

- Keep commits focused and well described.
- Follow the style of existing files.
- Document any manual steps if you add new scripts or tools.
- There are no automated tests to run by default.
